> Bring GitHub back to life.

### Motivation
“Did anyone die?” - that was our first thought when we saw GitHub’s new header. It turns out it’s their new iterative design.

After a little searching we found out that not only we, but the majority of GitHub users don’t like it. So we decided to get the old header back, i.e. bring GitHub back to life.

### Uniqueness
Our extension is the first extension that brings GitHub’s old header back without any flickering.
We love GitHub and would like it to be perfect again!
