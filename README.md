### Extensions
- [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/git-revive/ofmmhicgoalbngodgmkblneinagjmcpp)

### Motivation 
On Feb 10, 2017 GitHub announced their new dark header. After a little searching we found out that not only we, but the majority of GitHub users don’t like it. So we decided to get the old header back.

### Uniqueness
Our extension is the **first** extension that brings GitHub’s old header back **without any flickering**.  
We <3 GitHub and would like it to be perfect again!
